TODO-LATER: Pi Version 1 stopPlay is not working.
TODO-LATER: Pi Version 1 swapColor example doesn't work, looks like a bug with swapColor. I might get rid
of swapColor if I make version 1 compatible with version 2 so no need to fix this right now.
TODO-LATER: Pi Version 1 Update -> Make version 1 the canvas2d version of Pi.js. Make it compatible with
version 2 but runs in canvas 2d.  I will only do this if there is a demand for canvas2d only mode.
TODO-LATER: Add support for non-fixed with fonts. Font will still load the same but should auto detect
the size of each character and then and use that for spacing.
TODO: Update play toml file for Version 2.0.
