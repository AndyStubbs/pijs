description = """
Sets the default anchor point for all image and sprite drawing operations on this screen. The anchor
point defines the relative starting position to draw the image, based a percentage of the image size
using the x/y coordinates as a starting point.

**Common anchor values:**
- `(0.0, 0.0)` - Top-left corner (default). The x/y position refers to the upper-left corner of the 
	image.
- `(0.5, 0.5)` - Center of the image. The x/y position refers to the center point. Useful for
	rotating images around their center or positioning sprites by their center point.
- `(1.0, 1.0)` - Bottom-right corner. The x/y position refers to the lower-right corner of the
	image.
- `(0.5, 0.0)` - Top-center. Useful for UI elements that should align at their top edge.
- `(0.5, 1.0)` - Bottom-center. Useful for characters or objects that stand on a surface.

The anchor affects all image drawing commands (`drawImage`, `drawSprite`, `blitImage`, `blitSprite`)
unless they explicitly specify their own anchor point. This setting persists for the current screen
until changed.
