Gets the underlying HTMLCanvasElement DOM element for the active screen. This can be used for
direct canvas manipulation or integration with other libraries.

Note: This is for applying CSS styles to the canvas or moving the canvas in the DOM. You cannot
call getContext( "2d" ) on the returned canvas element as it already has a WebGL context. If you
want to use a 2d canvas context on a screen you can create a new DOM canvas and draw it as an image
on the screen.
