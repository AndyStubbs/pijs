Sets the sensitivity threshold for analog stick axes. Values below this threshold will be treated
as zero to account for stick drift. The sensitivity value must be between 0 and 1.

A value of 0 means no dead zone (all input is registered). A value of 1 means maximum dead zone
(almost no input registered). Typical values are around 0.1-0.3.
