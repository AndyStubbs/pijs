description = """
Draws pixels from a 2D array of palette indices. The array is indexed as [row][col] with
row = y, col = x. Index 0 is transparent and is skipped unless include0 is true.

You can call this using positional parameters or an object literal:

- Positional: $.put( data, x, y, include0 )
- Object: $.put( { "data": data, "x": x, "y": y, "include0": true } )

Behavior:
- Pixels are clipped to screen bounds.
- Negative x/y start positions are supported; data is clipped accordingly.
- If no pixels fall within the screen after clipping, nothing is drawn.
- Data should contain palette indices (typically from $.get with asIndex=true).
