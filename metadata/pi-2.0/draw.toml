Draws using a BASIC-style, case-insensitive draw string composed of commands.

Supported commands:

- "B": Before a line move, hides the line move (blind move).
- "Cn": Set the color attribute to palette index n.
- "C#RRGGBB": Set the color using a hex value (e.g., C#FF00FF).
- "Mn, n": Move to absolute coordinate (x, y) without drawing.
- "N": Return to the starting position after the next drawn segment.
- "Pn[, n]": Paint enclosed area from the cursor using color index; optional boundary color index.
- "Dn": Draw a vertical line DOWN n pixels.
- "En": Draw a diagonal line UP and RIGHT n pixels each direction (slash /).
- "Fn": Draw a diagonal line DOWN and RIGHT n pixels each direction.
- "Gn": Draw a diagonal line DOWN and LEFT n pixels each direction (slash /).
- "Hn": Draw a diagonal line UP and LEFT n pixels each direction.
- "Ln": Draw a horizontal line LEFT n pixels.
- "Rn": Draw a horizontal line RIGHT n pixels.
- "Un": Draw a vertical line UP n pixels.
- "Sn": Set scale factor; n in [1..255], actual scale is n/4 (default 1).
- "An": Set angle by quadrant; n in {0,1,2,3} maps to 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°.
- "TAn": Turn Angle; set any angle n from -360 to 360 degrees.
- "ARCn, n, n": Draw an arc with radius, start degrees, end degrees using the cursor as center.
