Creates a pool of audio instances from a single audio file. This allows playing the same sound
multiple times simultaneously without waiting for previous instances to finish. The pool uses
round-robin selection to cycle through available instances.

The audio file will be loaded asynchronously. Use $.ready() to wait for all audio to load.
