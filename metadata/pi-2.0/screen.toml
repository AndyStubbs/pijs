Creates a new WebGL2 canvas screen and sets it as the active screen. The screen command must be
called before any graphics commands can be used.

Aspect ratio format: `(width)(x|e|m)(height)`
- **x**: Exact pixel dimensions (e.g., "300x200")
- **e**: Extend mode (e.g., "100e100") - extends canvas to fill container while maintaining aspect ratio
- **m**: Multiple mode (e.g., "300m200") - scales to exact multiples of target resolution

For offscreen screens, only exact pixel dimensions (x) are allowed.
