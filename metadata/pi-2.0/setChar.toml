Modifies a character in the current screen's font atlas by replacing its bitmap data. The character
must exist in the font's character set. The data can be provided as a 2D array of 0/1 values or
as a hex-encoded string.

This updates the WebGL texture for the font, so the change is immediately visible when that
character is printed.
