description = """
Registers a callback function that will be called when a keyboard key event occurs. The callback
receives key data including the key name, code, location, and keyCode.

Supports two event modes:
- "down": Triggered when a key is pressed down
- "up": Triggered when a key is released

You can register handlers for single keys (string or keyCode), key combinations (array of keys),
or use "any" to listen for any key press. For key combinations, the mode must be "down" and all keys
in the combination must be pressed simultaneously.

The callback function receives (keyData) for single keys or an array of keyData objects for key
combinations. The keyData object contains: key (the key name), location (key location), code (the
key code), and keyCode (numeric key code).
