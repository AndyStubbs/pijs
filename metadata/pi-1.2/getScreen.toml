Retrieves the screen API object for a specific screen ID. This allows you to call all the graphics
operations for a specific screen. This means you do not have to call setScreen to set the active
screen every time you want to draw on a different screen. There is also a tiny performance advantage
for drawing commands called directly on a screen object.
