Shows a virtual onscreen keyboard below the current print cursor position. The keyboard supports
two modes: "text" for full keyboard with letters, numbers, and symbols, or "number" for numeric
input only.

The keyboard renders using the print-table plugin and responds to touch/mouse input. Keys are
highlighted when pressed and simulate keyboard events that can be captured by the keyboard plugin.

Requires the 'print-table' plugin to be loaded. The keyboard will automatically hide when the
screen is removed.
